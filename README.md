# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can estimate the selling price of a house.


## Installation
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [[ House Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata)], containing information about houses including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other relevant factors influencing house prices.

## Usage
To train and evaluate the model, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts provided:
   ```
   jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

## Model Training
The project employs machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to predict house prices. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are used to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Visualization techniques like scatter plots and residual plots are used for better understanding of model performance.
